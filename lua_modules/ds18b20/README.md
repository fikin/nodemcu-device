# DS18B20 and DS19B20

Temperature sensor over OW connectivity.

Loosely based on [nodemcu-firmware/lua_modules](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/release/lua_modules/ds18b20/ds18b20.lua) but with greatly simplified code.

It assumes the sensors are **powered** i.e. there is no provision for _parasitic_ powering mode.
