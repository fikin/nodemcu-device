# HTTP Server

This is rather elaborate (number of files) http file server.

It is not *true* http server and it does not have complete `Content-Length` support except for exact size.

It is designed to delegate request processing to a *web module*.

List of modules is defined in device settings.

It is implemented using coroutines to deal with async nature of IO communication.
